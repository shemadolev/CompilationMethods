- Symbol tables
    - varTable
    - functionTable

- Optimization: when parsing exp->num, we can skip assignment of temp register, and just assign the known value into exp.knownValue
    But this means, that whenever accessing exp from now on, we first need to check if knownValue exists.

- Think how to handle return value: should 'call' create a temp? If not, and it passed the place of the fixed return value reg, what
    if another function is called? (e.g a = foo(a) + foo(a))

- add 'concatList' to all places we added markers

- Caller / calle on 'call' to function

- header injenction (in main)

- all classes implemenatations
